# LALRPOP highlight

Extension that provides highlighting for [LALRPOP](https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop).

Currently, the grammar is just the Rust syntax from [zargony/atom-language-rust](https://github.com/zargony/atom-language-rust/blob/master/grammars/rust.cson). It seems to work okay, but I may update it with LALRPOP-specific syntax later.
